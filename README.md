# SMUI

3. **Prepare controllable elements**  
- Each GameObject you want to control should have a child with an `SMUIElement` attached.  
- The demo uses `SMUIActivationElement` to activate/deactivate GameObjects, but you can implement custom behaviors such as:  
  - Fading in/out  
  - Playing animations  
  - Any other state-dependent effect
